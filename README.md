**Brief summary**

For each token $t_i$ that Model $\mathcal{M}$ will generate: ( line 2 )

1. calculate the token distribution $\mathbb{P}_i$ ( line 3 )
2. check whether $t_i$ is chaotic. ( line 4 )
3. If so, apply **SED** on $\mathcal{M}$ to determine $t_i$. ( line 5-9 )
4. If not, select $t_i$ through standard decoding method. ( line 10-11 )
5. update the context. (`generated_tokens.append`) ( line 13 )

## Data Augmentation
We show how the augmented datasets are constructed in `./gsm8k_data_gen` and `./hotpotqa_data_gen`.
The former employs *few-shot* for data construction, whereas the latter utilizes *zero shot*.
For dataset [XieZhi](https://github.com/MikeGu721/XiezhiBenchmark), the pipeline is quite similar to GSM8k with nuanced differences.
You can make minor changes to the relevant code in `./gsm8k_data_gen` to obtain the augmented data for XieZhi.

For `./gsm8k_data_gen` and `./hotpotqa_data_gen`:
1. obtain [train.jsonl](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gsm8k) for GSM8K and the HotpotQA subset of [MRQA 2019](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mrqa) for HotpotQA.
2. Execute `1_xxx.py`, `2_xxx.py` and the rest programs sequentially according to the index number at the beginning of the name. Note, the output of the pre program serves as input for subsequent programs.

Following the steps above, you can obtain the augmented data for your specific dataset. 

Finally, you will obtain data in two formats:

1. $(q, a)$ for training LLMs' generation ability.  ($\mathcal{D}_{gen}$)
2. $(q, a, j)$ for training LLMs' evaluation ability. ($\mathcal{D}_{eval}$)


There are three examples for explanation:

**(q, a)**
```

  "Step1: It was reported that 2000 cases of Coronavirus had been confirmed in the state of New York in May 2020. \nStep2: There was half the number of cases in California, which means California had 2000/2 = 1000 cases.\nStep3: California had 400 more cases than the state of Texas, so Texas had 1000 - 400 = 600 cases.\nStep4: To find the total number of cases that had been confirmed in all of these states, we add the number of cases in each state: 2000 + 1000 + 600 = 3600.\nSo, the final answer is $3600."

## Training
We utilize the [KW-CutGPT](https://huggingface.co/XuYipei/kw-cutegpt-13b-ift) training script for supervised fine-tuning. 

You may refer to this [instruction](https://github.com/Abbey4799/CuteGPT/blob/main/README.md) to reproduce this work.


## Self-Evaluation Decoding
`logits_processor_utils.py` implements Self-Evaluation Decoding through `LogitsProcessor` class, which is explained in related [HuggingFace Document](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.41.2/en/internal/generation_utils#logitsprocessor). 

`logits_processor_utils.py` exactly follows the framework of **Algorithm 1** mentioned above. 
It takes the generated tokens and the predicted logits of the current token as inputs, and the modified logits as outputs to control the token selection.
You may refer to it for more details.

## Inference
The model inference on three datasets follows the same process. 
Here we take GSM8K as an example. 
`infer.py` is the corresponding source code, mainly consisting of three modules.

1. **read data.** Read test dataset. Parse the data into prompts and labels. The former is used for model inference, while the latter is used for evaluation.
2. **inference.** First, initialize the model. Then select the decoding method for the model based on the command line parameters. Finally, use the model for inference.
3. **evaluation.** Extract answers from the model responses and compare them with the labels to calculate the accuracy.

Step 2 explains how to apply SED to inference.
You may refer to `infer.py` for more details.
